Welcome to my R Workshop portfolio!

This is a website I edited in R to display my work from this summer. Below are some projects that I worked on using R. The main post is of my final project, but there's some other posts where I'm just practicing and playing around to get a feel for R as a programming language.

Feel free to use the "Categories" tab on the right hand side to navigate these posts better.
