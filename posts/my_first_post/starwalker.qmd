Here I'm trying out making a blog post using R and then porting it to the website connected to it. I'll take this opportunity to talk about Starwalker.

For whatever reason, the .png file will not properly preview in R, but it seems to generate OK on the website, so this is great news!

### Who is the Original                 Starwalker?

In the recently released (at the time of this post) game, DELTARUNE, the original Starwalker is a character you can meet in the first section of the game, Chapter 1. After being chased by a Starwalker-resembling character that will attack you with star-shaped bullet entities, you can walk back to the start of the path you were chased on and interact with Starwalker.
